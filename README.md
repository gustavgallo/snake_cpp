# 🐍 Snake (Terminal C++)

This is a small end-of-vacation project I made to get used to programming again after spending some time away from coding.

The goal was to warm up my logic, object-oriented design, and overall C++ workflow by building a classic Snake game that runs entirely in the terminal.

## Features

- Object-oriented Snake implementation
- Keyboard input (WASD)
- Wrap-around movement
- Terminal-based rendering
- Simple and clean structure

## Purpose

After taking a break from programming, I wanted to build something small but structured enough to practice:

- C++ fundamentals
- Classes and encapsulation
- Game loop logic
- Basic terminal rendering

This project is mainly focused on refreshing my programming skills and rebuilding consistency.
